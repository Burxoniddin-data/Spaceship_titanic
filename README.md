# 🚀 Spaceship Titanic: Predicting Passenger Transport
This repository contains my solution for the **Spaceship Titanic** competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic). The goal is to predict whether passengers aboard the Spaceship Titanic were transported to an alternate dimension during a catastrophic event.

## 🔍 Problem Overview
The **Spaceship Titanic** competition is a binary classification challenge where the target is `Transported` (True/False), indicating whether a passenger was transported to another dimension.

### Dataset
- **Features**:
  - `HomePlanet`, `CryoSleep`, `Cabin`, `Destination`, `Age`, `VIP`, and various expenses like `RoomService` and `FoodCourt`.
- **Target**:
  - `Transported`: Binary label (True/False).

---

## 🚀 Approach
### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized distributions of features and relationships with the target variable.
   - Identified and handled missing values.
### 2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extracted new features from `Cabin` (e.g., deck, side).
   - Engineered aggregated features (e.g., total expenses).
   - Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
### 3. **Model Building**
   - Tried multiple machine learning models:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
   - Optimized models using grid search and cross-validation.
### 4. **Evaluation**
   - Assessed models using accuracy on the validation set.
   - Selected the best model for final predictions.
